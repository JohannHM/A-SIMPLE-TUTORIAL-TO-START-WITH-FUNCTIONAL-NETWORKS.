# A-SIMPLE-TUTORIAL-TO-START-WITH-FUNCTIONAL-NETWORKS.
Here we are! The main idea is to who how we can build up a functional brain network from a EEG recording database, then visualize some network features in the brain network. So let's star! (Since v. R2015b and henceforth).

The use of graph theory and complex systems for functional connectivity (Clicking in the image a PDF copy). This tutorial of brain complex networks had been prepared by Johann H. Martínez. Working with raw time series of EEG, frequency band decomposition, Building up the correlation-based brain networks (different type of correlations), visualize matrix representation of graphs, work with matrix rewiring and thresholding methods. Here we use of the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (BCT) by Sporns et al, Matlab Tools for Network Analysis by MIT. Thanks to David Legland for your function "double2rgb.m". Dataset were extracted from the paper by Chennu et. al. PlosOne (2016).

Codes are prepared in Matlab® R2018a and it will run from R2015b, because of the Matlab Graph Toolkit.
The complete tutorial can be visualized HERE. from this MathWorks FileExchange_link or from my GitHub_repository. DataSet is included in previous links, however, please, email me for any query, question, function or data of this tutorial, don't hesitate to contact me.
